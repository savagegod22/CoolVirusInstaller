# CoolVirusInstaller
A fake virus installer that can be used for fun! Made entierly with Swift and SwiftUI.

Works with macOS Catalina (10.15.X) and higher.

I made this app in less than an hour.

## !!! This is not a real virus installer !!!
If you have doubts, check the source code!

# How it works:

1. You click "Start installation"
2. It says "Installing Virus"
3. When it completes the progress bar, it says "Installation complete!"
4. The app crashes on purpose
